# Shiny-Application-and-Reproducible-Pitch

This peer assessed assignment has two parts. First, I created a Shiny application and deployed it on Rstudio's servers. Second, I I used Rstudio Presenter to prepare a reproducible pitch presentation about my application.

My Shiny Application uses user selections to filter down the data based on desired qualities. The results of the filtered data are presented in plot and table format. 

Future directions could include using a dataset with similar attributes and include wine and vineyard names in order to find and purchase the desired wine.
